                                      <p>Surah  al-Rum is one of the most outstanding evidences of the Quran being the Word of  God and the Prophet Muhammad (saw) being a true Messenger of Allah. </p>
                                      <p>The  surah outlines the close relation between people&rsquo;s situations and life&rsquo;s  events; the past, present and future in human life and universal laws. This  shows that every little action, event, growth, consequence, setback and victory  are all closely linked, and subject to an accurate law. In all these, the final  decision rests with God: <em>&ldquo;All power of decision belongs to Allah before and  after.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v.4)</em> This truth is confirmed time after&nbsp;time in  the Qur&rsquo;an, because it is the basic truth in the Islamic faith which gives rise  to all concepts, values and standards.</p>
                                      <p>The  discourse begins with the theme that the Romans have been overcome and the  people the world over think that the empire is about to collapse, but the fact  is that within a few years the tables will be turned and the vanquished will  again become victorious.</p>
                                      <p>When  God showers His mercy in the form of Revelation and Prophethood, it also gives  a new life to mankind and causes it to grow and develop and flourish.</p></td>

                                        He  has a degree in English and Arabic from Westminster University, London and two  diplomas in Arabic from France and Syria. In Syria he completed a four year  Islamic law programme in the Institute of Al-Fath in Damascus. This was an  intensive course in which he studied in detail many texts both classical and  contemporary, dealing with most of the major Islamic disciplines such as  Qur'anic exegesis, Hadith studies, Islamic theology, law, literature, poetry  and contemporary Islamic thought. His private tuition with notable scholars  included several classical texts in Arabic grammar, Islamic law, Maqasid al-Shariah  and Jurisprudence.</td>

The Prophet (saw) said: <em>&ldquo;It will be said to the  companion of the Quran: Recite and rise in status, recite as you used to recite  in the world, for your status will be at the last verse that you recite.&rdquo;</em> The  status of the one who has memorised the Quran is indeed an honourable one.</p>
                                      <p>Allah (swt) says in  the Quran<em> &ldquo;and We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and  remember: then is there any that will receive admonition?&rdquo;</em> Yet many of us  find it very difficult to memorise the Quran. The difficulties you have could  be for a wide range of reasons such as poor memory skills, concentration, time  or simply lack of motivation, to name a few.</p>
                                      <p>For the first time    we are delivering a course which will give you an insight into how you can memorise the Quran,  learn the etiquettes, the best methods and times, the pre-requisites, as well  as&nbsp; how to overcome common obstacles and  difficulties in memorising the Quran, and much more.</p>

                                        The impulse to pray is among the most universal and innate of  human behaviours &ndash; asking God to relieve, pardon, give, soothe, protect, guide,  forgive, support, save and bless. Whether said in silence or uttered aloud,  with others or alone, prayer has always been at the core of spiritual wellness -  the lasting answer to an uncompromising condition of life. </p>
                                      This course on Qur&rsquo;anic du&rsquo;as  will present a lucid, bold and moving account of the Qur&rsquo;an&rsquo;s &ldquo;heroes of  prayer&rdquo; especially the Prophets (including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus  and Muhammad (may Allah bless them and grant them peace)), as well as believing  men and women, and angels. These du&rsquo;as and supplications are presented in the context  of their missions and circumstances and bear extraordinary relevance to our  world and lives today.</td>

                                      <p>The main body of surah al-Qasas deals with aspects  pertaining to:</p>
                                      <ul type="disc">
                                        <li>Musa       and Pharaoh:&nbsp;Tackling the issues of power and authority illustrated by       the ruthless and tyrannical character of Pharaoh.</li>
                                        <li>Qarun       and his treatment of Musa&rsquo;s people:&nbsp;Demonstrating the value of wealth       and the value of knowledge.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                      <p>Pharaoh and Qarun exalted themselves and tyrannised the Children of  Israel by using the brute force of authority and financial power. <strong>Learn how</strong> the end for  both was of a similar nemesis/retribution.</p>
                                      <p>You will <strong>learn</strong> that  ultimately neither of these opposing forces were capable of resisting Allah&rsquo;s  direct power which subsequently intervened to put an end to the tyranny and injustice.  Both examples show that where evil and corruption are manifest to the point where  those who are good and righteous are powerless to stop it;<strong> </strong>Allah Almighty intervenes directly to put an end to it all.</p>
                                      <p>The surah ends with <strong>Allah&rsquo;s promise</strong>: <em>&ldquo;Never call  on any deity side by side with God. There is no deity other than Him.  Everything is bound to perish except Himself. With Him rests all judgement, and  to Him you all shall return.&rdquo;</em> (57:88)</p>

One of the  distinguishing characteristics of the Muslim society is that all its activities  are directed to Allah. The whole society is dedicated to playing its destined  part in the universal order. The task of the Muslim community is to recognise  Allah and to make Him recognised, and to worship Him and to make it easy for  others to worship.</p>
                                      <p>Surah al-Hadid was  revealed to persuade the Muslims to make monetary sacrifices, and to make them  realise that Islam did not merely consist in verbal affirmation and some  outward practices but its essence and spirit is sincerity towards Allah and His  Religion. Faith and spending are two principal elements for the success of the  Community in achieving its end. Good use of money in the service of belief is  the practice of the people of sincere belief. </p>
                                      <p>The basis of accepted  belief is acknowledgement of Allah, self-denial, mercy to creatures and  kind-heartedness.</p>
                                      <p>Humility and mercy  cultivate acceptance and love. Pride and severity only result in contention and  fighting.</p>

The surah takes its name from Maryam (Mary), mother of  Isa (Jesus) and contains the story of the miraculous circumstances surrounding  his birth. The surah also contains brief stories of other prophets preceding  Muhammad (saw) and the people who lived after them, highlighting the fate of  those that lived in accordance with the guidance brought by the prophets and those  who went astray.</p>

                                        <li>Prophethood, underscored by obedience to Allah (swt) and its rewards</li>

                                      <p>Throughout the surah,  reference is made to Allah&rsquo;s attributes of compassion and beneficence, with  specific examples of Allah&rsquo;s mercy on those who submit to Him and supplicate to  Him earnestly in their time of need.</p>

Many schools of  interpreting the Qur&rsquo;an developed and voluminous books of tafsir were penned.  The discipline of tafsir expounded on the direct and subtle meanings of Qur&rsquo;an  and thus ensured that its teachings remained relevant to all people in all time  and ages.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Surah an-Naml reminds the believers of  the good tidings of faith in Allah&rsquo;s book and makes the unbelievers aware of  the Hereafter through the realities of the universe. This Surah consists of two  main discourses: the first is directed to those who accept the Qur&rsquo;an as it  presents the realities of the universe and the hereafter. Such people can  benefit from the guidance of the Quran and become worthy of the promises made  in it. The second discourse is directed to those who disbelieve in the Hereafter.  On the outset attention is drawn to the universe in order to question them  about the glaring realities. </p>
                                      <p>Four stories from the past have been  retold in order to understand their trails and tribulations in their struggle  towards belief, which are:</p>
                                      <ul type="disc">
                                        <li>The Story of Musa (as) and Pharaoh</li>
                                        <li>The People of Thamud</li>
                                        <li>The People of Lot (as)</li>
                                        <li>The Story of Sulayman (as) and Queen of Sheba (it is the only time this story is related in the       Qur&rsquo;an)</li>
                                      </ul>
                                      <p>The greatest hindrance for mankind in  following His Book, is the denial of the Hereafter. This Surah seeks to remind  the believers to the follow up their belief with obedience and submission in  their practical lives.</p>

This  course will extract examples of intelligence, faith, trust, envy, lust, greed,  power, infatuation, deceit, patience and forgiveness that is not only an  emotional study of the life of one of our greatest Prophets but also very  potent to the life we live today.<br>

The Prophet [saw] recommended that this sacred verse be recited in  the morning and evening, before going to sleep and after the obligatory prayers  for blessings, to ward off evil and for protection against Satan.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                                        The Qur&rsquo;an changed the course of human  history. This one day intensive course will introduce the science of tafsir  (Qur&rsquo;anic exegesis or the commentary of the Qur&rsquo;an) &ndash; which is considered one  of the most important disciplines of the classical Islamic sciences. The  Majestic Qur&rsquo;an was divinely revealed in the Arabic language and scholars  throughout the ages have sought to understand and interpret its profound  meanings in the context of the time and space they occupied. Many schools of  interpreting the Qur&rsquo;an developed and voluminous books of tafsir were penned.  The discipline of tafsir expounded on the direct and subtle meanings of Qur&rsquo;an  and thus ensured that its teachings remained relevant to all people in all time  and ages.&nbsp; </p>
                                      <p><strong>The core themes covered in this course  includes: </strong></p>

                                            <p>Surah al-Fatihah (The Opening) is not only the first chapter of the Qur&rsquo;an but also the &lsquo;gateway&rsquo; to the Qur&rsquo;an. It acts as both an introduction to and a summary of the whole Qur&rsquo;an. It is a supplication (du&rsquo;a) for guidance and the whole Qur&rsquo;an is presented as a response to that supplication. It is one of the earliest revelations and these &lsquo;seven oft-repeated&rsquo; verses in prayer. The surah stresses the Lordship and all-pervading Mercy of Allah and shows us the true relationship between our Creator and creation. It is described as the &lsquo;Mother of the Qur&rsquo;an&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Greatest Surah in the Qur&rsquo;an&rsquo;.<br>
                                                <br>
                                              Ayatul Kursi (Verse of the Throne) is described in the Hadith as the &lsquo;Greatest verse (ayah) in the Qur&rsquo;an&rsquo;. This unique verse of ten statements, describes the majesty of Allah and His dominion over the world as symbolised by the &lsquo;Throne&rsquo;. It is said that the &lsquo;Greatest Name of Allah&rsquo;, through which supplications are accepted, is contained within it. You are encouraged to recite this sacred verse in the morning and evening, before going to sleep and after the obligatory prayers for blessings, to ward off evil and protection from Satan.<br>

                                              During this course, we will analyse every word and elaborate their meaning and occurrence in the Qur&rsquo;an in the light of classical and contemporary Tafsir. Come and find out about the descriptions of our Creator in the greatest surah and ayah of the Qur&rsquo;an and how reflection on the Divine Names is a vital tool in understanding the Qur&rsquo;an. </p></td>

Muslim   women are unsure about performing their religious duties while in a state of   menstruation. This course will develop your understanding understanding of the   legal Islamic rulings on menstruation as they pertain to many aspects of your   daily lives. The objective of this course is to give you the ability to   recognise the issues and to deal with them and &nbsp;will help you answer a wide   variety of common questions such as:&nbsp;</p>

                                          <li> I want to perform the Hajj and I'll use pills to delay my cycle as it's my only opportunity to go. I really can't take the risk of bleeding during Hajj. Is this a right choice?</li>
                                          <li> I've missed two months of fasting due to post natal bleeding. What do I do?</li>
                                          <li> I've just had a coil placed inside, and it has changed my regular cycle of 7 days to 13 days. Is this my new cycle?</li>
                                          <li> I am bleeding but it's not red. Can I consider it as menstruation? </li>

                                          The impulse to pray is among the most universal and innate of  human behaviours &ndash; asking God to relieve, pardon, give, soothe, protect, guide,  forgive, support, save and bless. Whether said in silence or uttered aloud,  with others or alone, prayer has always been at the core of spiritual wellness -  the lasting answer to an uncompromising condition of life. </p>
                                    This course on Qur&rsquo;anic du&rsquo;as  will present a lucid, bold and moving account of the Qur&rsquo;an&rsquo;s &ldquo;heroes of  prayer&rdquo; especially the Prophets (including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus  and Muhammad (may Allah bless them and grant them peace)), as well as believing  men and women, and angels. These du&rsquo;as and supplications are presented in the context  of their missions and circumstances and bear extraordinary relevance to our  world and lives today.</td>

Muslim   women are unsure about performing their religious duties while in a state of   menstruation. This course will develop your understanding understanding of the   legal Islamic rulings on menstruation as they pertain to many aspects of your   daily lives.

                                            <li> I've missed two months of fasting due to post natal bleeding. What do I do?</li>
                                            <li> I've just had a coil placed inside, and it has changed my regular cycle of 7 days to 13 days. Is this my new cycle?</li>
                                            <li> I am bleeding but it's not red. Can I consider it as menstruation? </li>
